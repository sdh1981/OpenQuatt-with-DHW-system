# Release Process

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated validation, firmware compilation, and release asset publishing.
Style and documentation consistency are validated locally via `./scripts/validate_local.sh` on bash hosts or `.\scripts\validate_local.ps1` on Windows. The current style scope is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Branch Model

- `main`: stable branch for tagged releases and the default OTA/update channel. Small docs/ops fixes may be committed directly to `main` when appropriate.
- `dev`: integration branch for testers. Validate it like `main`, but do not cut stable tags from it.
- feature branches: short-lived branches merged into `dev`; promote `dev` into `main` only after validation/soak.
- if `main` and `dev` diverge after a release (for example because of a direct `main` fix or a non-fast-forward promotion), realign `dev` with the released `main` commit before starting the next development cycle. Then apply the next dev-version bump as a new commit on top.

Firmware should expose its channel explicitly via `release_channel` so Home Assistant and the ESPHome web UI show whether a device is running `main` or `dev`.

## Workflows

- `/.github/workflows/ci-build.yml`
  - Trigger: push to `main` or `dev`, pull requests
  - Actions:
    - `esphome config openquatt_duo_waveshare.yaml`
    - `esphome compile openquatt_duo_waveshare.yaml`
    - `esphome config openquatt_duo_heatpump_listener.yaml`
    - `esphome compile openquatt_duo_heatpump_listener.yaml`
    - `esphome config openquatt_single_waveshare.yaml`
    - `esphome compile openquatt_single_waveshare.yaml`
    - `esphome config openquatt_single_heatpump_listener.yaml`
    - `esphome compile openquatt_single_heatpump_listener.yaml`
    - Upload compiled firmware artifacts per profile
- `/.github/workflows/release-build.yml`
  - Trigger: tag push `v*` and manual dispatch
  - Actions:
    - validate + compile all four topology/hardware profiles
    - publish explicit Duo and Single release assets for both hardware targets
    - generate `openquatt-duo-ota.manifest.json` and `openquatt-single-ota.manifest.json` for OTA update checks
    - create/update GitHub Release
    - attach release firmware binaries and OTA manifests to the release
- `/.github/workflows/dev-build.yml`
  - Trigger: push to `dev`, manual dispatch
  - Actions:
    - compile all four profiles with `release_channel=dev`
    - override `project_version` to `${base_version}-dev.<run_number>+<shortsha>`
    - move the mutable `dev-latest` tag to the newest `dev` commit
    - publish/update a prerelease that contains binaries + OTA manifests for the dev channel
- `/.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml`
  - Trigger: push to `main` when docs/install assets change, published stable release, successful `Release Build`, manual dispatch
  - Actions:
    - check out the `main` branch docs as the Pages site source
    - download the latest stable `*.firmware.factory.bin` assets from GitHub Releases
    - mirror those first-install binaries into the Pages artifact under `/firmware/main/`
    - deploy the resulting site via GitHub Pages Actions

## ESPHome Version Pinning

- CI/release build with a pinned ESPHome version from `/.github/requirements-esphome.txt`.
- Keep release builds deterministic by updating this pin via PR (instead of using floating `latest`).
- A scheduled canary workflow (`/.github/workflows/esphome-canary.yml`) validates compatibility against the latest ESPHome.

## Release Versioning

Use semantic versioning tags:

- `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Examples: `v0.12.3`, `v0.13.0`

Recommended increments:

- Patch: bug fixes, docs, CI changes
- Minor: new backward-compatible functionality
- Major: breaking changes

Keep the source-controlled `project_version` aligned with the next intended stable release. Published dev-channel artifacts should override that at build time to `${project_version}-dev.<run_number>+<shortsha>` while also setting `release_channel=dev`. The monotonically increasing prerelease number is important: SemVer ignores everything after `+`, so SHA-only build metadata does not count as a newer OTA version on its own.

## Channel Metadata

- `project_version` in `openquatt/oq_substitutions_common.yaml` remains the user-facing firmware version.
- `release_channel` in `openquatt/oq_substitutions_common.yaml` identifies the running channel (`main` or `dev`).
- `release_manifest_url` selects which OTA manifest the built-in update entity uses.
- `Firmware Update` checks the selected OTA manifest every `4h`.
- `Firmware Update Channel` is a runtime select that switches the OTA manifest between the baked-in `main` and `dev` URLs and immediately refreshes the update entity.

The running firmware exposes both `OpenQuatt Version` and `OpenQuatt Release Channel` in diagnostics, while `Firmware Update Channel` controls which OTA track the device should follow next.

## Building a Dev Channel Firmware

Reuse the existing topology/hardware entrypoints and override channel-specific substitutions at build time:

```bash
BASE_VERSION="$(awk -F'\"' '/^project_version: / { print $2 }' openquatt/oq_substitutions_common.yaml)"
DEV_STAMP="$(date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"
DEV_VERSION="${BASE_VERSION}-dev.${DEV_STAMP}+local"

esphome \
  -s project_version "${DEV_VERSION}" \
  -s release_channel dev \
  -s release_manifest_url https://github.com/jeroen85/OpenQuatt/releases/download/dev-latest/openquatt-duo-ota.manifest.json \
  compile openquatt_duo_waveshare.yaml
```

Equivalent Single builds should use:

```text
https://github.com/jeroen85/OpenQuatt/releases/download/dev-latest/openquatt-single-ota.manifest.json
```

This keeps the topology/hardware matrix independent from release channel selection.

The repository now backs that URL with `/.github/workflows/dev-build.yml`, which publishes a mutable prerelease/tag named `dev-latest`.

## How To Cut a Release

1. Update `project_version` in `openquatt/oq_substitutions_common.yaml` on `dev`.
2. Push `dev` and wait for `CI` and `Dev Build` to go green.
3. Promote the validated `dev` commit to `main`. Recommended path: fast-forward `main` to `origin/dev`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
git merge --ff-only origin/dev
git push origin main
```

You may still use a release PR when you want a reviewed release summary on GitHub, but the ruleset no longer requires that path.

4. Wait for `CI` on `main` to go green.
5. Create and push a tag from the merged `main` commit:

```bash
git fetch origin
git tag v0.13.0 origin/main
git push origin v0.13.0
```

6. Check GitHub Actions:
   - CI should be green.
   - Release workflow should publish artifacts.
7. Verify GitHub Release contains:
   - `openquatt-duo-ota.manifest.json`
   - `openquatt-single-ota.manifest.json`
   - `openquatt-duo-waveshare.firmware.ota.bin`
   - `openquatt-duo-waveshare.firmware.factory.bin`
   - `openquatt-duo-heatpump-listener.firmware.ota.bin`
   - `openquatt-duo-heatpump-listener.firmware.factory.bin`
   - `openquatt-single-waveshare.firmware.ota.bin`
   - `openquatt-single-waveshare.firmware.factory.bin`
   - `openquatt-single-heatpump-listener.firmware.ota.bin`
   - `openquatt-single-heatpump-listener.firmware.factory.bin`
8. If `main` and `dev` no longer point to the same release content, realign `dev` with the released `main` commit before bumping to the next development version:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout dev
git reset --hard origin/main
git push --force-with-lease origin dev

# then bump to the next dev version, commit, and push
```

If you used the recommended fast-forward promotion and did not add extra `main`-only commits afterwards, `dev` and `main` already align and you can skip this reset.

## Notes

- The baseline `openquatt_duo_waveshare.yaml` is secrets-free and suitable for CI builds.
- First-install UX now lives on the GitHub Pages installer at `https://jeroen85.github.io/OpenQuatt/install/`, which builds ESP Web Tools manifests dynamically in the browser against same-origin stable factory binaries mirrored onto Pages.
- `openquatt-duo-ota.manifest.json` and `openquatt-single-ota.manifest.json` are intended for OTA update flows.
- Duo firmware reads `${release_manifest_url}` from `openquatt_base.yaml`, Single firmware reads it from `openquatt_base_single.yaml`.
- OTA manifests and OTA binaries remain on GitHub Releases; only first-install factory binaries are mirrored onto Pages for Web Serial/CORS compatibility.
- Workflow files must remain directly under `.github/workflows/` (GitHub does not load workflows from nested subfolders).
